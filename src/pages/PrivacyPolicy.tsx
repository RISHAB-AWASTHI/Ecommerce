            <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium text-[#FF4D00] mb-4">Security: How We Protect Your Information</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We implement robust physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. The third party service providers providing payment gateway and payment processing services are all validated as compliant with the payment card industry standard (generally referred to as PCI compliant service providers).
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Despite our best efforts, no system is entirely secure. Users are advised to keep their login credentials confidential. AOIN is not liable for breaches resulting from unauthorized access caused by user negligence. We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control. You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your AOIN account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your username and password, we will consider that you have authorized the instructions and will not be liable for any breach or subsequent loss arising out of such perceived authorization.
